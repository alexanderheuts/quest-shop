## QuestShop

QuestShop is a lightweight Minecraft (NeoForge) mod that provides an in-game shop and reward progression system.
It is designed for modpack makers to support controlled item access, team play, and quest progression.

### üéØ Purpose

* Provide a configurable shop where players can spend earned rewards. 
* Support progression gating ‚Äî rewards and purchases can be tied to team progress or quest completion.
* Stay lightweight and flexible for modpack integration.

### üîå Integrations

QuestShop works on its own, but offers optional integration with:

* FTB Teams ‚Äì for shared team progression.
* FTB Quests ‚Äì for quest-based rewards or unlocks. 

_No hard dependencies: packs can include QuestShop standalone or alongside these mods._
