## QuestShop

QuestShop is a lightweight Minecraft (NeoForge) mod that provides an in-game shop and reward progression system.
It is designed for modpack makers to support controlled item access, team play, and quest progression.

Inspired by [FTB Money](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-money-forge).
